                    <h2>Tesla electric trucks</h2>
                    <p class="p">Tesla’s Semi is off to a promising start,
                         despite there being no official pricing information
                          available yet</p>
                    <p class="para">Tesla has said that its cost of operation
                         for the Semi will help shippers save money on a per
                          mile basis right away, and that’s likely meant to
                           help lessen the impact of sticker shock when it
                            finally does reveal the upfront price. But as I 
                            mentioned with the Walmart pilot, which will
                             involve a trial of 15 Semi trucks across
                              the U.S. and Canada, there’s additional value
                               in helping these major shippers meet their
                                green targets.</p>
